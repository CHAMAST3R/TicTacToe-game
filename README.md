# TicTacToe-game

## Background
Created a TicTacToe game to leverage and practice my understanding of functions. This was the first project that was part of the udemy python bootcamp course by Jose Portilla: [Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)

## Setup
 Welcome to TicTacToe\
\
Before you run the game are sure that you have a Python environment installed on your system.\
\
For Windows open up your CMD window and type `py`\
\
For Linux based OS, type `python`\
\
If it states a version Python exists on the system, if not you will need to install it.\
\
Once installed change your director pointer to the Blackjack folder.\
\
Then run the `main.py` script by the following command: `py main.py` or `python main.py` for Linux\
\
Enjoy the Game.
